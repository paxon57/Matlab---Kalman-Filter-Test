# Matlab - Kalman Filter Test

This is just a personal learning project

Objective: Based on Radar reading estimate plane position

Map Size: 10 km x 10 km (Adjustable)
Random Radar Positioning
Random Flight Pattern

## Kalman Filter
Check "Kalman Filter" branch for working Kalman Filter

In this scenario radar provides position information with 150 meter noise.

Tweak settings at the top of main.m

Run main.m to perform the simulation

## Extended Kalman Filter
Main branch contains EKF

In this scenario radar provides distance and angle.

Less than 30 meter accuracy achieved with radar sensor noise of 50 meters for range and 1 degree for angle

Tweak and run main.m
