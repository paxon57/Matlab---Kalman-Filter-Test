# Matlab - Kalman Filter Test

This is just a personal learning project

Objective: Based on Radar reading estimate plane position

Map Size: 10 km x 10 km (Adjustable)
Random Radar Positioning
Random Flight Pattern

## Kalman Filter
Check V1 branch for working Kalman Filter

Tweak settings at the top of main.m

Run main.m to perform the simulation

## Extended Kalman Filter
Main branch contains EKF

Less than 30 meter accuracy achieved with radar sensor noise of 50 meters for range and 1 degree for angle

Tweak and run main.m
